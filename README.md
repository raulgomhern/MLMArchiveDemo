# MLMArchive Demo
<br/>

The Medialab Madrid Archive (MLM Archive) Demo is a digital educational resource to help students to develop study materials connected to transdisciplinary examples from the Medialab Madrid projects. It allows them to engage in an interactive way with academic heritage at the same time they are developing creative skills with a STEAM methodology.
